when having issue importing aar in android(native) part of flutter plugin, what to do is to convert aar to a jar file
by following steps below:
1 - change aar extension to zip
2 - unzip the library an copy classes.jar file to android/libs folder of the project which is way easier to import
3 - then in the dependencies session of ur gradle add
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
4 - build or run and u are good to go
